The sun rises at dawn, the sky empty of clouds, but still the contrary currents remains, making it impossible to leave the island. The sailors are stuck for days, maybe weeks. From the top of the mast, one of your sailors screams: \"Houses in north-east!\" Your crew, tired of the long weeks on the sea, seems eager for exploration. On the west, many suspicious small sand dunes separate the crew from an estuary. Right where they stand, there are multiple entrances of caves leading within the massive plateau the island is made of. Finally on the east, a mountain peak right next to the village, but it seems still quite a challenge to climb. The crew wonders which direction to take."

Your party realizes the feast under their feet, and not only them: a horde of colossal eagle-like volatiles massively surrounds the sailors, one eagle grabbing the crab in its claws before releasing it from high altitude on a rock. Gathering his meal, the flying tribe heads back north, in the direction of a high plateau covered with trees. The place must be filled with life.

Another specie looks like a huge umbrella, with only its flat treetop bearing leaves; looking closer, a red mixture comes out of the treetrunk: dragonblood! An antique, very rare product used for medicine and rituals. Looking up, the tree hosts a huge nest on its treetop, bearing a large, red egg guarded by a bird of red feathers. Looking around, the luxurious plateau continues further to the east."

As they approach one of them, a gigantic crab, all golden yellow with a white, massive claw, escapes the dry dune and runs to the sea. Your party realizes the feast under their feet, and not only them: a horde of colossal eagle-like volatiles massively surrounds the sailors, one eagle grabbing the crab in its claws before releasing it from high altitude on a rock. Gathering his meal, the flying tribe heads back north, in the direction of a high plateau covered with trees. The place must be filled with life."
