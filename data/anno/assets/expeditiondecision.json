Having travelled for many days along the New World coast, &lt;b&gt;it is now time to decide how you will travel on from here.&lt;/b&gt; Ahead, a broad brown rivermouth invites you upstream, its perils waiting unseen beyond its bends. \"Perhaps a route overland will be more forgiving?\" says the navigator hopefully. One look at the dark and foreboding line of trees would suggest nothing could be further from the truth. \"But which is the lesser of evils, Admiral?\"",

Another specie looks like a huge umbrella, with only its flat treetop bearing leaves; looking closer, a red mixture comes out of the treetrunk: dragonblood! An antique, very rare product used for medicine and  rituals. Looking up, the tree hosts a huge nest on its treetop, bearing a large, red egg guarded by a bird of red feathers.
